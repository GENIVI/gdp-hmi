GENIVI is providing Diagnostic Log and Trace component also called DLT. It is a
reusable open source software component for standardized logging and tracing in
infotainement ECUs based on the AUTOSAR 4.0 standard. The goal of DLT is the
consolidation of the existing variety of logging and tracing protocols on one
format.

Launcher2 is also a way for GENIVI to show how to use DLT in a client point of
view. It is advised to read the wiki page built to help using DLT.

In the case of Launcher2 the traces can be configured to use DLT enabling in
.pro file the flag USE_DLT
